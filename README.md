When brainstorming what to build for my dashboard, I realized that I wanted to create something impactful for the public. I then recognized the need for a centralized platform to help individuals find the best medical services for them. So, I realized that it would be useful to create a dashboard that consolidates hospitals and medical centers based on location and their performance in addressing various health conditions.

One of the initial challenges I faced was finding a dataset that would provide the most relevant data for my purposes. I scoured the internet and finally found one dataset, but still, the "score" column had many n/a's. I initially thought that removing these n/a's would be best, but after consideration, figured that leaving the n/a's would not take away from the main purpose of the project, and could better inform the users by still leaving the option for the medical office available. I then started implementing dropdown menus for selecting states and zip codes. However, I soon realized the importance of dynamically populating the zip code dropdown based on the selected state. So, I had to learn how to chain the dropdowns.

As I delved deeper into the dashboard's design, I recognized the significance of visual representations in conveying complex information effectively. I figured that a bar graph would be best to compare hospital scores, intuitively presenting users with insights into each facility's performance. I also integrated a data table to offer a comprehensive list of hospitals along with their addresses, further enhancing the user experience. To optimize user interaction, I then recognized that it would be useful for both the graph and table to be sorted based on hospital scores, from highest to lowest.

Thematically, I figured a maroon colored theme would be most relevant for the purposes of this dashboard. I didn't want to overdo the theme with too many colors and pictures as this might overwhelm the user, who is really just trying to find a medical center for a medical emergency.

Through this journey, I built upon my knowledge in data science concepts, from data preprocessing and visualization to user interface design and interactivity.
